## Installing ffmpeg

In order to save animations as mp4/m4v/mov/etc... files, you must [install ffmpeg][0], which allows for conversion to many different formats of video and audio. For macOS users, installation may be [easier using Homebrew][2].

For Windows, go to *Edit the system environment variables* (search from Windows menu), then navigate to *Advanced* > *Environment Variables*. In the Environment Variables window, select Path, click new and enter the `ffmpeg\bin` location you have saved in your system.
After installation, ensure that `ffmpeg` has been added to your path by going to your command line and entering `ffmpeg -version`.

## Install ImageMagick for animated gifs

If you desire to create animated gifs, you'll need to [install ImageMagick][1]. Verify that it has been added to your path with `magick -version`.

## Dependencies

Bar Chart Race requires that you have both matplotlib and pandas installed.
